Starting Up NPM Server
	Setting up the web server is very easy currently!
	First, we need to clone the repository of the website. To do this, do `git clone https://github.com/robertrenecker/boulderTrimble`
	
	From there, we will want to go into the webapp (`cd boulderTrimble/webapp`).
	
	Do `npm install` to install the necessary packages for the website.

	If you don't have npm on that computer, run `sudo apt-get install nodejs` and `sudo apt-get install npm` to install it!

	From there, just do `npm start` to start up the server!
